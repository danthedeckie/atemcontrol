# atemcontrol (in python)

So far, merely refactoring the great work started by others.

## Roadmap:

1. Continue clean up
2. Test basic text-based interface on Rasberry Pi
3. Flesh out library to cover more 'real' API.
4. pygame/SDL interface, and make interfaces in general more generic & plugable.
5. boot-to-controller Raspberry Pi image
6. drink coffee.
