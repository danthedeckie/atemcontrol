# atemcontrol (in python)

So far, merely refactoring the great work started by others.

## Roadmap:

1 - Continue clean up
2 - Test basic text-based interface on Rasberry Pi
3 - Flesh out library to cover more 'real' API.
4 - pygame/SDL interface
5 - boot-to-controller Raspberry Pi image
6 - drink coffee.
